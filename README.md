# blogson
This is an old blogging project I made in 2003. The oldest date I could find was 1/26/2003 when I was at Pittsburgh Technical Institute.

# development
blogson is written almost entirely in jsp. There is a servlet for creating an image for email addresses.

# goal
The goal of adding this old project to github is to modernize it.

* use gradle to build and run
* use spring for controllers instead of the action.jsp
* use database connection pooling and datasource instead of connection.jsp
* use spring to display rss feed

There may be more to come like using markdown instead of html for posts and comments.
